<h2 align="center">Neutron - DAO</h2>

## Overview

The Neutron governance is based on [DAO DAO](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts) contracts, with some modifications. In addition, we implemented 3 contracts that manage Neutronâ€™s funds.

- **The Neutron DAO**
- **Multiple subDAOs**
- **The Treasury** holds the vested NTRNs and sends them to the Reserve and Distribution contracts;
- **The Reserve** contract keeps the funds that have already vested, but were not sent to the Distribution contract. Is is used by the neutron DAO for one-off payouts;
- **The Distribution** contract is responsible of the second step of token distribution where tokens sent to this contract are distributed between `share holders`, where `share holders` are a configurable set of addresses with number of shares. This contract allows share holders to withdraw collected tokens.

The Neutron DAO creates subDAOs by executing Neutron DAO proposals that contain *Instantiate* messages for the subDAO contracts.

## Testing 

1. from `neutron` run: `make init`
2. run `./test_proposal.sh`
3. see that proposal has passed
4. as well everybody can run `./test_subdao_proposal.sh` with same results

We also have decent amount of integration tests
